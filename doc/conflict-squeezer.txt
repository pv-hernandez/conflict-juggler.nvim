		 A tool to simplify merge conflicts in Neovim

COMMANDS

						*:ConflictSqueezer*
:ConflictSqueezer
:[range]ConflictSqueezer	Simplifies the conflicts in the current
				buffer.  If executed with the [range]
				parameter, simplifies the conflicts only in
				the range.

Conflics are identified by "<<<<<<<", "|||||||", "=======" and ">>>>>>>" at
the start of a line.  This command moves common lines from the start of a
conflict block above the conflict block, and moves common lines from the end
of a conflict block below the conflict block.  If the resulting conflict block
is empty, it removes the conflict markers.

Take the following conflict as an example: >
    some code
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    common head
    my changes
    common tail
    =======
    common head
    their changes
    common tail
    >>>>>>> remote
    some more code
<

After executing `:ConflictSqueezer`, the code looks like this: >
    some code
    common head
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    my changes
    =======
    their changes
    >>>>>>> remote
    common tail
    some more code
<

The line "common heading" was removed from both sides of the conflict block.
As this line was at the start of both sides, it was moved before the conflict
block.  The line "common tail" also was removed from both sides of the
conflict block.  Since it was at the end of both sides, it was added after the
conflict.

This command supports conflicts that contain clean nested conflicts, i.e. when
both the starting and the ending markers are inside a section of block.  When
there are nested conflicts, this command simplifies the outtermost blocks
only.  To simplify internal conflicts you can use visual mode to select the
internal block conflict and run the command with de selected range.
